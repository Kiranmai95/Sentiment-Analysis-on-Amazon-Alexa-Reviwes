# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Alexa-Reviwes


## Problem Statement
Every business likes to understand the customers or clients by knowing their opinions about the product.
They collect some valuable feedback or reviews about the product from customers to get to know their
satisfaction level with the product. The business user has to manually read the reviews which is written in
the text form, which is a tedious process. Instead, by performing sentiment analysis on reviews, can figure
out if the review is positive or negative. This way the business user with out reading each and every review
will get to know the people opinion on products. Finally, business owner can consider several factors like
improving the production quality, weather to increase the production or not to increase the production.
In this project, I will be performing sentiment analysis on the reviews of Amazon Alexa products so that
amazon can know the people have positive or negative opinion on their Alexa products.
